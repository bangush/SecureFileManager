### Building
`TODO:`

```
If you simply want to build the main application for demo / testing purposes, you can do so by
1. Clone the repo
2. Remove reference to Project.DesignData in the main project (SecureFileManager)
3. Rebuild All (Ctrl + Shift + B in Visual Studio)
4. Explore the application.
```
